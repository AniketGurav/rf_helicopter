# Overview

**Objective**: Create a Reinforcement Learning algorithm to learn to play and complete the track

# Files

Descriptions added as headers for each file. Main files to run and plot models are: main.py and plot_results.py

### TODO: Coursework Tasks

* **5%** - Define a Domain and the task - Write Up
* **5%** - Define a State Transition Function - Write Up
* **5%** - Define a Reward Function - Write Up
* **5%** - Choose a Policy - Write Up
* **5%** - Represent the Problem as a Graph - Write Up
* **5%** - Set the original R-Matrix - Code
* **5%** - Set the parameter values for Q-Learning - Code
* **10%** - Set the original Q-matrix and show how it is updated in a learning episode
* **10%** - Case 1 - Represent performance vs episodes

* **5%** - Case 2: for repeating the experiment in Case 1 with different gamma values
* **5%** - Case 3: for repeating the experiment in Case 1 with different learning rates
* **5%** - Case 4: for repeating the experiment in Case 1 with different policies
* **5%** - Case 5: for repeating the experiment in Case 1 with different state and reward functions

* **5%** - for the scope of the problem - Write Up - Increased Complexities [Fuel, Gravity, nb Actions, wind]
* **20%** - for analysis of results and comparing performance in Case 1, Case 2, Case 3 and Case 4 (5% each)
